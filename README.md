# MGA Tally
This is a tally for the Market Garden Arena in Jump Academy. You'll need to hook up a google sheets API key. Run app.py and it should prompt you to sign into google. This will get you `credentials.json` and a `token.pickle` file.

## How to use it
run `app.py` in console using `py app.py` (or however you'd like to run it).  
The app uses Ridge's scoring system as of 09/28/2020. If it changes, I will try to update the app to match.  
Currently, it is not linked to JA, but when it is, there will be a webhook on the JA server running the app (hopefully).
