# MGA Tally
This is a tally for the Market Garden Arena in Jump Academy. You'll need to hook up a google sheets API key. Run app.py and it should prompt you to sign into google. This will get you `credentials.json` and a `token.pickle` file.

## How to use it
run `app.py` in console using `py app.py` (or however you'd like to run it).  
The app uses Ridge's scoring system as of 09/28/2020. 

UPDATE 9/29/20:  
 - Squid is planning on reimplementing the old system in some manner. This app doesn't have much of a use anymore. It was a good run :P
